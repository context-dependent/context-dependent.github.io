      <description>When first presented with the syntax of ggplot2, I found it so alien to the way that I had previously thought of making plots that my brain basically rejected it. Coming from other plotting functions in R, other statistical programs, or excel, its understandable that people would be intimidated and confused. Part of this is the layering system that the package uses to draw the plot. You set up an object, mapping data to aesthetic parameters, and then use functions (geoms) to interpret the mapped data in a specific way.</description>
