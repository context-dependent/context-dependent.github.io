      <description>This is the first in a series of articles that will use historical data from NFL seasons between 1992 and 2016 to illustrate some data munging, analysis, and visualization techniques in R. Pro-Football-Reference.com has a wealth of freely available detailed historical data. We are going to use rvest and dplyr, part of the tidyverse, to scrape, clean, and concatenate that historical data.
library(rvest) library(dplyr) library(readr) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) Why should we automate this?</description>

      <description>When first presented with the syntax of ggplot2, I found it so alien to the way that I had previously thought of making plots that my brain basically rejected it. Coming from other plotting functions in R, other statistical programs, or excel, its understandable that people would be intimidated and confused. Part of this is the layering system that the package uses to draw the plot. You set up an object, mapping data to aesthetic parameters, and then use functions (geoms) to interpret the mapped data in a specific way.</description>
