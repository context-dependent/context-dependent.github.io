Teaching friends and acquaintances how to use R has inspired me to collect the examples that I've given them into a blog, and potentially expand on them in preparation for future lessons. I should be clear that I'm neither an expert statistician, nor an expert programmer, but that I use R to do lots of data analysis and visualization in my work as a researcher.

The website was built using the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium-theme).
